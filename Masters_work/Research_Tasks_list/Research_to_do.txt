                                Research Tasks: 12/4 to 12/15

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Finish Rebinning studies:  ()
A. l3_shapes (Mean, RMS, Staterror_logscale/Reg plot, RMS_staterror) 
B. Rhich_shapes (Mean, RMS, Staterror_logscale/Reg plot, RMS_staterror) 
C. Exponential_shapes (Mean, RMS, Staterror_logscale/Reg plot, RMS_staterror) 
D. Analyze results/Write down what's seen and notices (Latex/word document report) (Write problem/answer why to do this and properties) 

** Side Notes save .txt files when needed **
2.  l_3 studies:  ()
A. RMS_Staterror plot with a trend on locus of points (Draw Region/best fit) (all statistics) 
B. RMS_Staterror plot with a trend on locus of points (Draw Region/best fit) (all statistics_Low pt) 
C. RMS_Staterror plot with a trend on locus of points (Draw Region/best fit) (all statistics_Low pt) (High and Low P_1's)
D. RMS_Staterror plot with a trend on locus of points (Draw Region/best fit) (all statistics and energies) (Both l3 and Exp datas) 
E. Research another correlation test and test it on RMS/staterror plot or another one genrally on l3. Look up how it could affect p1 measurements of this 
F. Aswer question why RMS/Staterror tests matter and how it affects whole method.  (Try this) 
G. For errors on logscales tally try to find distribution connections, chi-square, or any other affects on the p1 error's to adjust.  
H.  Analyze results/Write down what's seen and notices (Latex/word document report) (Write problem/answer why to do this and properties) 


3. Quick Redo Exponential Studies (Redo: all pt, 1 mill 10 mill 100 mill):  ()
A. RMS, Mean, Staterror_logscale/Reg, RMS_staterror plots

4. Analyze all Results (**important one to summarize **) in document form for presentation later. ()

5.  Make presentation for Grad_lab Monday talk on towerslope: ()
A. Read thesis intro/detector info on 3-main papers and sphenix design template
B. Include important towerslope discussion/results of fall 2024 

6. Final Presentation (important details) encompassing Fall 2024 (** Use this to practice like Masters's Defense **) ()
